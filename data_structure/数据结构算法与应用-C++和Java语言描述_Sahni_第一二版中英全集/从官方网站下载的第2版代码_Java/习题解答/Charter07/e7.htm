We can prove this by induction on <code class=var>u</code>.
In the induction base, we establish the result for <code class=var>u = 0</code>.
When no unions have been performed, each class has exactly one element.
Therefore, no class has more than <code class=var>u+1 = 1</code> element.
<br><br>
In the induction hypothesis, we assume that no class has more than
<code class=var>u+1</code> elements when the number of unions is at most
<code class=var>m</code>, where
<code class=var>m</code> is an arbitrary natural number.
<br><br>
In the induction step, we must show that no class has more than
<code class=var>m+2</code> elements when the number of
unions is <code class=var>m+1</code>.
Consider the class <code class=var>A</code> with the largest number of elements.
This class has more than one element, and so it is the result
of one or more unions starting from singleton classes.
Suppose that the last union performed to create <code class=var>A</code>
united classes <code class=var>B</code> and
<code class=var>C</code>. 
The maximum number of union operations used to create
<code class=var>B</code> and
<code class=var>C</code> is
<code class=var>m</code> (note that one union is used to unite
<code class=var>B</code> and
<code class=var>C</code> to create
<code class=var>A</code>, leaving
<code class=var>m</code> unions for the creation of other classes).
Let <code class=var>b</code> be the number of union operations performed
to create <code class=var>B</code>.  The number used for
<code class=var>C</code> is at most
<code class=var>m-b</code>. From the induction hypothesis it follows that
the number of elements in <code class=var>B</code> is at most
<code class=var>b+1</code> and the number in
<code class=var>C</code> is at most
<code class=var>m-b+1</code>.  Therefore, the number of elements in
<code class=var>A</code> is at most
<code class=var>b+1+m-b+1 = m+2</code>.
<br><br>
<dt> (b)
<dd>
There are three cases for a union operation: it unites two
singleton classes, it unites a singleton class and a nonsingleton
class, and it combines two nonsingleton classes.
The first case reduces the number of singleton classes by two,
the second by one, and the third by zero.  Therefore, after
<code class=var>u</code> union operations the number of singleton classes
is at least
<code class=var>n-2u</code>.
<br><br>
<dt> (c)
<dd>
Each union reduces the number of classes by one.  Therefore,
after <code class=var>n-1</code> unions, the number of classes is one and no further
unions can be done.  So <code class=var>u &lt; n</code>.
