Each <code class=code>char</code>, in Java, is <code class=var>16</code> bits.
Therefore, the two left shifts and adds of Program 11.13 essentially
concatenate the binary representations of the rightmost three characters of
<code class=code>s</code>.
Further, since a <code class=code>long</code> is <code class=var>64</code>
bits and the concatenation of the three characters affects only the
least significant <code class=var>3 * 16 = 48</code> bits of
<code class=code>answer</code>, no bits are lost during the left shifts
and there is no overflow during the adds. Therefore, at the end,
the least significant <code class=var>48</code> bits of
<code class=code>answer</code> faithfully represent the concatenation
of the <code class=var>16</code> bits in each of the three characters
of the input string <code class=code>s</code>.
Consequently, different three-character strings
<code class=code>u</code> and <code class=code>v</code>
are converted into different numbers.
