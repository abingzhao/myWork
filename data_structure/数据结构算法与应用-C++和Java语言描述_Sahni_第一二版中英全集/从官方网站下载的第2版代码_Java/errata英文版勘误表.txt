Positive line numbers are from the top of a page, negative numbers are from the page bottom. 

The codes in the text employ the interface Computable (Section 1.13.1), which is in the package utilities. This interface is extended by the interface Operable (Section 1.13.4). If you are using Java 1.5, you will run into problems because Java 1.5 defines its own interface Computable. Java 1.5 users should rename Computable to MyComputable, wherever Computable is used in the codes you download.

Page 77, Example 2.8. x^n should be x^i. 
Page 162, line -8. IllegalArgumentException should be IndexOutOfBoundsException.

Page 233, Figure 7.1. C.firstNode = 10 should be c.firstNode = 5. 
Page 426, Theorem 11.1. 1/alpha should be 1/p. 
Page 410, Program 11.7. Math.round should be Math.ceil.
